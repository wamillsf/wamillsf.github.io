Hi all. We’re getting close to the release of the Phase 2 of the Blockchain Tycoon. New office building and staff characters are ready. You will have the option to upgrade the staff computers. We’re almost done with the 3D models and the next step is to redesign the user interface. The UI will use the color palette of the popular dark mode themes in many applications. See you on the next dev log.
